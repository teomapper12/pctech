           <p>To build a PC you need to have :<br>
             1 - Motherboard<br>
             2 - Processor<br>
             3 - Cooler for Processor<br>
             4 - Ram Memory<br>
             5 - Graphic Card or Integrated Graphics<br>
             6 - Hard Disk or SSD<br>
             7 - Power Suply<br>
             8 - Case<br>
             STEP 1:Install Processor in Motherboard
             Take the motherboard out of its antistatic packaging and put it on your work surface. Find the CPU socket, which will be covered with a protective plastic cap. In one corner of the plastic cap, or more commonly, on the socket itself, you'll see a small arrow — take note of where this arrow is.
             Next to the CPU socket, you'll see a small metal lever. Press down on the lever and pull it gently to the side (away from the socket) to open the socket tray.
             Open the CPU and remove it from its packaging. Be very careful when handling the CPU — both the CPU and the CPU socket are extremely susceptible to physical damage. Hold the CPU on the edges — never touch the pins on the bottom of the chip, because your fingers can add dust or oil, and try not to touch the top of the chip either.<br>
             STEP 2: INSTALL CPU COOLING
             Parts/tools: Motherboard with installed CPU, CPU cooler, thermal paste, CPU cooler manual
             There are different types of CPU coolers. For exact installation instructions, we recommend you consult the manual that came with your CPU cooler.
             Some coolers require a mounting bracket. The motherboard may have a bracket pre-installed; you may need to remove this bracket if your cooler doesn't need a bracket, or replace this bracket if your cooler uses a different bracket. Do this before putting the motherboard inside the case.<br>
            STEP 4: INSTALL MEMORY (RAM)
            Parts/tools: Motherboard, RAM, motherboard user manual
            Determine how many RAM slots your motherboard has (most have either two or four). If you're going to fill all available RAM slots, simply snap the RAM into place. If you're not going to fill all of the RAM slots, consult the user manual to find the correct configuration and populate the RAM slots accordingly.<br>
            STEP 5:PUT MOTHERBOARD IN CASE
            If your motherboard came with an unattached I/O shield — a rectangular sheet of metal with cutouts for the motherboard's ports — you should first snap it into place in the back of your case (make sure it's oriented correctly). I/O shields usually have sharp edges, so watch your fingers.
            Once the I/O shield is in place, you can install the motherboard. Double-check to make sure your cables are all threaded through to the correct place, and then place the motherboard (align it with the I/O shield, first). Using a Phillips #2 screwdriver, mount the first screw — the center screw — to hold the motherboard in place. Make sure you do not drag your motherboard across the standoffs attached to the chassis.<br>
            STEP 8: INSTALL GPU
            Parts/tools: Motherboard, GPU, Phillips #2 screwdriver, screws, motherboard user manual
            Find the PCIe* x16 slot on your motherboard. It will be the longest PCIe* slot and may be a different color than the others. If your motherboard has more than one PCIe* x16 slot, check the user manual to see if one slot needs to be prioritized. If any slot can be used, determine which slot you'll be using based on where other components are placed — you want your GPU to have some breathing room.
            Depending on your case, you may need to remove I/O covers (small metal tabs blocking the back panel of your case) to accommodate your GPU's I/O (HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, etc.) and make it accessible to the exterior of the chassis.
            Remove the GPU from its antistatic packaging and carefully align it with both the rear retention bracket and the slot itself, and then gently push it into the PCIe* x16 slot (you may hear a click). The PCIe* tab on the motherboard may move into a locked position should you need to reseat the GPU.
            Once the GPU is fully seated, secure it to the back of the case using one or two screws. If your GPU requires auxiliary power connectors, connect it to the power supply.<br>
            STEP 9: INSTALL STORAGE
            Firstly, inspect your case. Every case is a little different when it comes to drive bays.
            You should be able to find a stack of bays in different sizes somewhere inside your case. They may have little plastic switches, in which case they are tool-free bays, or they may just look like metal brackets.
            Storage generally comes in two sizes, 2.5-inch (HDDs and SSDs) and 3.5-inch (HDDs). Most 3.5-inch bays can accept 2.5-inch drives, but not vice versa (some 3.5-inch bays will have trays that aren't designed for 2.5-inch drives, but they can still fit 2.5-inch bays). You may also see larger bays in your case — these are for larger drives such as optical drives and are usually located in the front of the case, near the top.
            If you have tool-free bays, each bay will have its own plastic lever or switch. Open or unlock the lever or switch and you should be able to pull out the tray. Place your drive in the tray — some 3.5-inch trays will be designed to accept 2.5-inch trays. If they are, you'll need to screw the 2.5-inch drive to the 3.5-inch tray so it doesn't move around.
            Slide the tray back into the bay. It should click into place.
            If you don't have tool-free bays, you'll see a metal bracket (it will be big, like a sheet), with slats or holes in it. To put a drive in one of these "bays," all you have to do is slide the drive between the metal bracket and the side of your case and screw it into place. Use as many screws as the chassis manual recommends, but if you don't have enough screws most drives will be fine with just two screws. Once your drives are all in place, connect them to the motherboard (using a SATA cable, which should have come with either your drive or yourmotherboard) and to the power supply.<br>
            STEP 10: INSTALL OPERATING SYSTEM
            If you haven’t already prepared your operating system (OS) on a USB flash drive, now is the time to do so. (See the above section on operating systems under “PREP 3: Select your components” for more details.)
            Plug in the USB flash drive that contains your OS, as well as a monitor, mouse, and keyboard, and turn on your PC.
            The first screen you see will tell you to press a key to enter the system setup or BIOS. Press the key to open BIOS. (If the screen flashes off too quickly for you to see the key, consult your motherboard's user manual.)
            First, you'll want to check to makes sure your components are all installed and being recognized. Find the page in BIOS that shows your PC's system info (different motherboards have different BIOS setups, but you should be able to find a screen that gives you this information) and check to make sure the system is recognizing everything you've installed so far.
            Next, poke around BIOS until you find the Boot page (may be called "Boot Order" or "Boot Priority"). Change the boot order so that your flash drive is first and the drive you want to install your OS on (if you're using an SSD as a boot drive, you will want to install the OS here) is second.
            Restart your computer. Your computer will boot from the USB and the OS installer will pop up. Follow the instructions to finish the installation.
