          <p>Early computers used relays, mechanical counters or delay lines for main memory functions. Ultrasonic delay lines were serial devices which<br> could only reproduce data in the order it was written. Drum memory could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory<br> items required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. Latches built out of vacuum tube triodes, and later, out of<br> discrete transistors, were used for smaller and faster memories such as registers. Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use<br> for large amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such memory could be provided.</p>
          <p1>The first practical form of random-access memory was the Williams tube starting in 1947. It stored data as electrically<br> charged spots on the face of a cathode ray tube. Since the electron beam of the CRT could read and write the spots on<br> the tube in any order, memory was random access. The capacity of the Williams tube was a few hundred to around<br> a thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches. <br>Developed at the University of Manchester in England, the Williams tube provided the medium on which the first <br>electronically stored program was implemented in the Manchester Baby computer, which first successfully ran a<br> program on 21 June 1948. In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory being designed for the Baby, the Baby<br> was a testbed to demonstrate the reliability of the memory.</p1>
          <p2>Magnetic-core memory was invented in 1947 and developed<br> up until the mid-1970s. It became a widespread form of random-access memory, relying on an array of magnetized rings. By <br>changing the sense of each ring's magnetization, data could be stored with one bit stored per ring. Since every ring had a<br> combination of address wires to select and read or write it, access to any memory location in any sequence was possible. <br>Magnetic core memory was the standard form of computer memory system until displaced by solid-state MOS (metal-oxide-silicon) <br>semiconductor memory in integrated circuits (ICs) during the early 1970s.</p2>
          <p3>Prior to the development of integrated read-only memory<br> (ROM) circuits, permanent (or read-only) random-access memory was often constructed using diode matrices driven by address decoders,<br> or specially wound core rope memory planes.[citation needed]
          Semiconductor memory began in the 1960s with bipolar memory, which used <br>bipolar transistors. While it improved performance, it could not compete with the lower price of magnetic core memory.</p3>
