           <p>A Graphic Card (also called Video card)is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a<br> display device (such as a computer monitor). Frequently, these are advertised as discrete or dedicated<br> graphics cards, emphasizing the distinction between these and integrated graphics. At the core of both<br> is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which is the main part that does the actual computations, but should<br> not be confused with the video card as a whole, although "GPU" is often used as a metonymic shorthand to refer to video cards.</p>
           <p1>Most video cards are not limited to simple display output. Their integrated graphics processor can perform additional processing, removing <br>this task from the central processor of the computer.For example, Nvidia and AMD (previously ATI) produced cards render the graphics <br>pipeline OpenGL and DirectX on the hardware level. In the later 2010s, there has also been a tendency to use the computing capabilities<br> of the graphics processor to solve non-graphic tasks, which can be done through the use of OpenCL and CUDA. Video cards can also be<br> used for AI training.[
           Usually, the graphics card is made in the form of a printed circuit board (expansion board) and inserted into an expansion<br> slot, universal or specialized (AGP, PCI Express).Some have been made using dedicated enclosures, which are connected to the computer via a docking station or a cable. These are known as eGPUs.</p1>
