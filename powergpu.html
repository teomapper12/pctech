        <div class="description">
           <p>As the processing power of video cards has increased, so has their demand for electrical power. Current high-performance video cards tend to consume large amounts of power. For example, the thermal design power (TDP) for the GeForce Titan RTX is 280 watts.[10] When tested while gaming, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Founder's Edition averaged 300 watts of power consumption.[11] While CPU and power supply makers have recently moved toward higher efficiency, power demands of GPUs have continued to rise, so video cards may have the largest power consumption of any individual part in a computer.[12][13] Although power supplies are increasing their power too, the bottleneck is due to the PCI-Express connection, which is limited to supplying 75 watts.[14] Modern video cards with a power consumption of over 75 watts usually include a combination of six-pin (75 W) or eight-pin (150 W) sockets that connect directly to the power supply. Providing adequate cooling becomes a challenge in such computers. Computers with multiple video cards may require power supplies over 750 watts. Heat extraction becomes a major design consideration for computers with two or more high-end video cards.</p>
