        <div class="description">
            
           <p>Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order,<br> typically used to store working data and machine code.A random-access memory device allows data items <br>to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the<br> memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and <br>the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly <br>depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media<br> rotation speeds and arm movement.</p>
            
            <p1>RAM contains multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed<br> storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is<br> accessed by the same <br> address, and RAM devices often have multiple data lines and are said to be "8-bit"<br> or "16-bit", etc. devices.</p1>
            
            <p2>In today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuit (IC) chips with MOS<br> (metal-oxide-semiconductor) memory cells. RAM is normally associated with volatile types of <br>memory (such as dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) modules), where stored information is lost if power is <br>removed, although non-volatile RAM has also been developed. Other types of non-volatile memories exist<br> that allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations on them. <br>These include most types of ROM and a type of flash memory called NOR-Flash.</p2>
            
            <p3>The two main types of volatile random-access semiconductor<br> memory are static random-access memory (SRAM)<br> and dynamic random-access<br> memory (DRAM). Commercial uses of semiconductor RAM date back to 1965, when<br> IBM introduced the SP95 SRAM chip for their System/360 Model 95 computer, and Toshiba used DRAM memory cells<br> for its Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator, both based on bipolar transistors. Commercial MOS memory,<br> based on MOS transistors, was developed in the late 1960s, and has since been the basis for all commercial semiconductor memory.<br> The first commercial DRAM IC chip, the Intel 1103, was introduced in October 1970. Synchronous dynamic random-access memory <br>(SDRAM) later debuted with the Samsung KM48SL2000 chip in 1992.</p3>
